# Installing git
git was installed as using the following commands in the terminal:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git -y

To make a github account you need to give a username and an email address

git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email "example@example.com"

# Committing the files

I made a directory on my local machine called "thesis", under my downloads directory; so to create a GIT repository I worked from this thesis directory and used the command:
"git init"
which initialized my Git repository in /home/breena/Downloads/thesis/.git/

I used the "git add <file name>" command to add each file to my repository; and then I used "git commit -m "Assignment 6" to commit these files to my github repository. 

## Output from git log and git diff

'git log' gave me the following output:

'git diff' gave no output


# Push the contents

git remote add origin https://github.com/BreenaMcCormack/thesis.git

Now there is a copy of my local repository on my github repository named thesis
